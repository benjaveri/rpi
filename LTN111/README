LTN111

For this project I connected the RPi to a now ancient Philips LTN111R-10 LCD
display and wrote various programs to display text, make animations en just
have fun.

You can find LTN111 datasheets here:

I have no idea where you can buy these - I've had mine for almost 25 years
just sitting on a shelf, so thought it would be fun to dust off and give a
whirl.
